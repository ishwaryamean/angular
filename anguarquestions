1. What is Angular?

Angular is a component-based framework for building structured, scalable and single page web applications for client side. 

2. What are Angular advantages?




It is Relatively simple to build Single Page Applications (Components)
To make flexible and structured applications (OOPS friendly)
It is Cross platform and Open Source (Free) 
Reusable code (Services)
Testability(specs)

3. What is the difference between Angular and Angular JS? OR What are the advantages of Angular
over AngularJS?


1. It only supports JavaScript. It support both JavaScript and TypeScript.

2. This framework has a model-view- This framework has a component controller (MVC) architecture. This  framework has a 
component based architecture.

3. It does not have CLI tool. It has CLI tool.

4. It does not use Dependency Injection. It uses Dependency Injection.

5 It does not support mobile browsers. It also support mobile browsers.

4. What is NPM?

NPM/ Node package manager is an online,repository from where you can get thousands of free libraries which can be used in your
angular project.

The node_modules folder is used to save all downloaded packages from inpm in your computer.

5. What is CLI tool?

CLl is a command-line interface tool that you use to initialize and develop Angular applications.

6. What are Components in Angular?

Components are the most basic UI building block of an Angular app.

Css file used for keeping the css code of the component. 

html file used for modifying the html template of the component. 

The spec file is used for writing unit tests for your component. 

Components is the file which link all the other component files.

7. What isa Selector and Template? 

A selector is used to identify each component uniquely into the component tree.

A Template is a HTML view of an Angular component.

8. What is Module in Angular? What is app.module.ts file?

Module is a place where you can group the components,directives, pipes, and services, which are related to the
application.

9. How an Angular App gets Loaded and started? What are index.html, app-foot, selector and main.ts?

Angular is used to create Single Page Applications. index.html file is that single page. index.html will invoke main.js 
file which is the javascript version of main.ts file.

main.ts file is like the entry point of web-app. It compiles the web-app and bootstraps the AppModule to run in the browser.

App module file will then bootstrap the Appcomponent.

App-component or app-root component is the html which you will see finally.

10. What is Data Binding in Angular?

Data binding is the way to communicate between your typescript code of your component and your html view.

11. What is String Interpolation in Angular?

String Interpolation is a one-way data-binding technique that is used to transfer the data from a TypeScript code(component)
to an HTML template (view). 

String interpolation can work on string type only not numbers or any other type. 

It is represented inside {{data}} double curly braces.

12. What is Property Binding in Angular?
 
Property binding is a superset of interpolation. It can do whatever interpolation can do. In addition, it can set an
element property to a non-string data value like Boolean.

13. What is Event Binding in Angular?

Event binding is used to handle the events raised by the user actions like button click.

14. What is Two way Binding in Angular?

Two-way data binding in Angular will help users to exchange data from the view to component and then from component to
the view at the same time.

Two way data-binding |(° ngiodel ")| = “data”

15. What are Directives? What are the type of directives?

Directives are classes that add additional behavior to elements in your Angular applications.

Structural directives change appearance of DOM by adding or removing elements

Attribute directives change appearance or behaviour of an element.

Component directives are directive with its own template.

16. What is *nglf Structural directive?

Structural Directives are classes that change appearance of DOM by adding or removing elements.

nglf Directive is used to add or remove items based on the if condition.

17. What is *ngSwitch Structural directive?

ngSwitch is an structural directive used in combination with *ngSwitchCase and *ngSwitchDefault that are
both structural directives.



18. What is *ngFor Structural directive?


The *ngFor directive is used to iterate a list of items and then display them.

19. What is [ngStyle] Attribute directive?

Attribute directives change the appearance or behavior of an element.

ngStyle is an attribute directive that updates styles for the HTML element.

20. What is [ngClass] Attribute directive?

Attribute directives change the appearance or behavior of an element.







ngClass directive adds and removes CSS classes on an
HTML element. 

21. What is the difference between Component, Attribute and Structural Directives?

Component directive is responsible for showing the first whole view. It is the most used one.
Starts with @ sign
Like: @Component


Structural directive is responsible for adding and deleting html elements in the view.
Starts with * sign.
Like: *nglf, *ngFor,*ngSwitch


Attribute directive is responsible for changing the  appearance of view by adding or removing style/css class of html elements.
Set inside Square brackets.
Like: [ngClass], [ngStyle]


22. What is Decorator? |

Angular decorators store metadata about a class, method, or property.

Metadata is "data that provides information about other data".

All decorators are represented with @ symbol.

23. What are the types of Decorator?

class Decorator:
@ngModule
@component
@injectable
@Directive
@Pipe

Property Decorator
@Input
@Output
@ContentChild
@ContentChildren
@ViewChild
@ViewChildren
@HostBinding

Method Decorators
@HostListner

Parameter Decorators
@inject
@Self
@Host
@SkipSelf
@Optional

24. What are Pipes? What are the types of Pipes & Parameterized Pipes?

Pipes are simple functions which accept an input value and return a transformed value.

Built-in-pipe

lowecase
uppercase
date
percentage
currency
decimal
slice
json

25. What is Chaining Pipes?

The chaining pipes use multiple pipes on a data input.

{{dob|date|uppercase}}

26. Explain Services with Example?

A service is a typescript class and a reusable cade which can be used in multiple components.

Service can be implemented with the help of dependency injection. 

27. How to Create Service in Angular?

ng generate service login

28. What is Provider in Angular?

A provider is an object declared inside decorators which inform Angular that a particular service is available for
injecting inside the components.
